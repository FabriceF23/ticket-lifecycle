<h3 align="center">Intake</h3>
<p>
  User **Ken** creates a ticket for help because he's having an issue.  
  He submits the ticket through the system.

</p>

<!-- Lifecycle Stage: Ticket Assignment -->
<h3 align="center">Ticket Assignment</h3>
<p>
  Support agent **John Doe** logs into the system and sees Ken's ticket.  
  He notices it’s an urgent ticket (Sev-A emergency), so he assigns it to a System Administrator for more help.

</p>

<!-- Lifecycle Stage: Communication -->
<h3 align="center">Communication</h3>
<p>
  Agent **John** writes a message to make sure the System Administrator knows the ticket is urgent.  
  He assigns the ticket with proper details so it can be handled properly.

<!-- Lifecycle Stage: Working the Issue -->
<h3 align="center">Working the Issue</h3>
<p>
  System Administrator **Jane Doe** logs in to see the ticket.  
  She begins to work on the problem and keeps **John** updated by communicating through the system.
</p>

<p>
  Once Jane fixes the issue, she changes the ticket status from **open** to **resolved**.

<!-- Lifecycle Stage: Resolution -->
<h3 align="center">Resolution</h3>
<p>
  Agent **John** sees that the ticket is now resolved. He gets a message from **Jane** saying the issue has been fixed.

<!-- Final Explanation -->
<p>
  This is a simple example of how a ticket gets created by a user, assigned to an agent, worked on, and finally resolved.  
  There can be more complex situations, such as:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The ticket being reassigned to another department.</li>
  <li>The ticket being escalated to a higher priority if the issue gets worse.</li>
  <li>The ticket being passed to a more qualified agent or department for better handling.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  This system helps ensure that issues are solved efficiently. On average, help desk agents might handle between **10 to 100 tickets** each day depending on the company size.
</p>

<p>I hope this guide helped you understand how a ticket moves through the system from the moment it's created to when it's resolved. If you’re interested in becoming a help desk specialist, practicing this process will help you get better at solving real-world issues!</p>**
