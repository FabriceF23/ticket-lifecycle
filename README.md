This tutorial explains how a ticket in the osTicket system goes from being created to being solved.

## Environments and Technologies Used

- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines/Computers)
- Remote Desktop
- Internet Information Services (IIS)

## Operating Systems Used

- Windows 10 (21H2)

## Stages of a Ticket's Lifecycle

- Intake: When a user submits a ticket.
- Assignment and Communication: The ticket is assigned to a team, and updates are shared.
- Working the Issue: The team works on fixing the issue.
- Resolution: The problem is solved, and the ticket is closed.

## The Stages Explained

### 1. Intake - When a User Sends a Ticket

In this stage, the user, Karen Doe, creates a ticket. She reports that her employees can’t access the online banking portal. This is the first step of the process where the user asks for help.

At this point, John, one of the employees, sees the ticket. He assigns it to the team that deals with online banking issues. John also makes sure to update Karen about the progress and sets a special priority (SLA) for the ticket.

### 3. Working the Issue

Jane, from the online banking team, picks up the ticket. She starts working on the issue and updates Karen, telling her that she’s actively working on a fix.

Finally, Jane finds a temporary solution to the problem. She shares this with Karen and explains the permanent fix. Once everything is solved, the ticket is marked as resolved.

This tutorial shows how tickets are created, worked on, and resolved in the osTicket system. While this is a simple version of what happens, sometimes tickets might need to be passed to different departments, their priority might be changed, or they might need more work from a different team.

Help desk agents often handle a lot of tickets every day, depending on the size of the company. Now that you've learned about the process, remember to clean up your Azure environment to avoid unnecessary charges.

Don’t forget to close your Remote Desktop connection and delete the resource groups you created at the beginning of the tutorial. Make sure they are deleted properly to avoid extra costs.
