### Working The Issue

This is a basic overview of how a user creates a ticket, how it's assigned, and how communication between agents & customers occurs, ultimately leading to a resolution.

However, there are additional scenarios that can arise while a ticket is being processed. A ticket may be reassigned to another department, its severity level may be escalated, or it may need to be reassigned to a more qualified agent or department, depending on the impact the ticket has on the business.

I hope this tutorial provides a clearer understanding and a better general overview of a ticketâ€™s life cycle. Help desk agents can expect to handle anywhere from 10 to 100 tickets per day, depending on the size of the company.

Now that we're finished, make sure to CLEAN UP YOUR AZURE ENVIRONMENT to avoid any unnecessary charges.

Remember to close your Remote Desktop connection, delete the Resource Group(s) you created at the start of the tutorial, and verify that the Resource Group has been successfully deleted.
